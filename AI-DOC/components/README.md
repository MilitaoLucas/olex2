# Olex2 Core Components

This directory contains detailed documentation for each of the main components of Olex2:

## Software Development Library (SDL)

The [SDL](sdl.md) provides foundational utilities and data structures used throughout the application, including memory management, file handling, mathematical algorithms, and core data structures.

## Crystallography Library (XLIB)

The [XLIB](xlib.md) implements domain-specific crystallographic functionality, including symmetry operations, space group handling, atom and bond representation, and refinement algorithms.

## Graphics Library (GLIB)

The [GLIB](glib.md) provides OpenGL-based visualization capabilities, including scene management, materials, lighting, and primitive rendering.

## Graphics Extensions Library (GXLIB)

The [GXLIB](gxlib.md) bridges the crystallography and graphics components, providing specialized rendering for crystallographic elements like unit cells, atoms, bonds, and planes.

## Application Layer (OLEX)

The [OLEX](olex.md) implements the user interface and application-specific functionality, including GUI, user interaction handling, and file management.

## Data Flow and Interaction

The [Interactions](interactions.md) document explains how these components work together to create the complete Olex2 application.
